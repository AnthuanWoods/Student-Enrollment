# Student-Enrollment

This application primarily uses a framework of JavaScript, Express. The application runs using the user's personal IP address on a specified port, 8081. This application allows the user to add a student through the form located at /add. The user gives the student's first name, last name, and program. This information is added to a list of enrolled students in the university. The list can be viewed at any time through the /list extension. Another feature of this application is the ability to remove a student from the university through the /delete form. A compiled list of the currently enrolled students is returned.  

UPDATE:
This application now has database applications, specifically local MongoDB. In order to run this code; node, express, and mongodb must be installed. 

Also an android studio project has some implementations of this project to run on mobile.
